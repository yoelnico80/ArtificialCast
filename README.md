## Introduction

In the world of artificial intelligence, data types and transformations play a crucial role. **ArtificialCast** provides a framework that ensures type safety while transforming data. With a focus on inference, it allows developers to avoid common pitfalls associated with type casting. This repository is built using C# and .NET technologies, making it a perfect fit for developers already working in these environments.

## Features

- **Type Safety**: Ensures that all transformations maintain type integrity.
- **Inference Powered**: Utilizes inference algorithms to simplify type casting.
- **Easy Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing C# and .NET applications.
- **Robust Documentation**: Comprehensive guides and examples for quick onboarding.
- **Active Community**: Join our discussions and contribute to the project.

## Installation

To get started with **ArtificialCast**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yoelnico80/ArtificialCast.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ArtificialCast
   ```

3. Restore the dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet build
   ```

5. You can download the latest release from the [Releases section](https://github.com/yoelnico80/ArtificialCast/releases). Make sure to download the appropriate file for your platform and execute it.

## Usage

Using **ArtificialCast** is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to illustrate how to perform a type-safe transformation.

```csharp
using ArtificialCast;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        var result = TypeCaster.Transform<SourceType, TargetType>(sourceObject);
        Console.WriteLine(result);
    }
}
```

In this example, `TypeCaster.Transform` handles the transformation between `SourceType` and `TargetType`, ensuring that all data is correctly cast.

### Example Scenarios

1. **Transforming Data Models**: Use **ArtificialCast** to safely convert between different data models, such as from DTOs to domain entities.

2. **API Responses**: When consuming APIs, you can ensure that the data received matches the expected types, reducing runtime errors.

3. **Machine Learning Data Preparation**: Safely prepare data for machine learning models by ensuring type correctness before training.
